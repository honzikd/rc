Currently, the project is in alpha-stage - the website runs pretty flawlessly on 
the testing server.

ABOUT DJANGO

I've used Django 1.4 together with Python 2.6 shipped with Apple Mac OS X 10.6.8.

Right now, I'm finding most interesting the creation of new user directly in the
registration process, using the django-registration app and signals.
